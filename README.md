# kubernetes

## Definition and why we need it.

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for container orchestration.

Kubernetes automates operational tasks of container management and includes built-in commands for deploying applications, rolling out changes to your applications, scaling your applications up and down to fit changing needs, monitoring your applications, and moreâ€”making it easier to manage applications.

## Docker

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

Docker allows you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

## why kubernetes

Demand for a proper way of managing large scale of containers.

## kubernetes features

1. High availability or no downtime.
2. Scalability of high performance.
3. Disaster recovery - backup and restore.

## kubernetes components

1. pod: an abstraction over container, smallest unit of k8s, each pod get its own IP address. (k8s create virtual networking.)
2. node: a node is a single worker machine within a Kubernetes cluster, responsible for running the actual applications and workloads.
3. cluster: a Kubernetes cluster is the overarching architecture that organizes and manages a collection of nodes, networks, and resources required to run applications.
4. service: a Service defines a logical grouping of Pods and exposes them through a single, stable IP address. It automatically manages routing and load balancing to distribute traffic across the set of Pods, even if Pods are dynamically created or removed.

- ClusterIP: Exposes the Service only within the cluster, using an internal IP address.
- NodePort: Exposes the Service on a specific port on each node in the cluster, making it accessible externally.
- LoadBalancer: Provisions an external load balancer (if supported by the cloud provider) and assigns it to the Service.
- ExternalName: Maps the Service to an external DNS name, allowing access to resources outside the cluster.

service provide:

- stable IP address
- loadbalancing
- communication inside and outside cluster.

5. ingress: Ingress in Kubernetes is used for managing and routing external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to services within the cluster.

- ingress controller: evaluates all the rules | manages redirections | entrypoint to cluster

6. ConfigMap: external configuration of your application.
7. Secret: ConfigMap saved in base64 encoded format.
8. Volumes: Volumes are storage abstractions that allow Pods to persist data across container restarts.

- Persistent Volume (PV): Represents the actual storage resource, which can come from an NFS, cloud disk, or other storage backends. (not namespaced!)
- Persistent Volume Claim (PVC): A request by a Pod to use a PV. When a PVC is created, Kubernetes attempts to bind it to an available PV or dynamically provision one based on a StorageClass.

9. Deployments: blueprint for pods with replica mechanism, which is designed for stateless applications, where each instance (or replica) of the application is identical and does not rely on a specific identity or stable storage.
10. StatefulSet: A StatefulSet is designed for stateful applications that require stable identities, persistent storage, or ordered deployment and scaling.

- asynchronoous streaming replication cluster.

11. Namespace: virtual cluster inside a k8s cluster, resources can be organized by namespace.
12. Storage class: create pv dynamically.
13. Job: In Kubernetes, a Job is a workload resource designed to run tasks that are finite rather than long-lived.
- CronJob: A CronJob in Kubernetes is a type of Job that runs on a schedule, similar to cron in Linux/Unix systems. It automates the execution of Jobs at specified intervals or times, making it ideal for recurring tasks like backups, batch processing, or report generation.

## kubernetes architecture

- Control Plane (Master Node):
  - API Server/ Kubernetes Dashboard (UI) / CLI --> Entrypoint to k8s cluster.
  - Scheduler --> ensure pods placement.
  - Controller Manager --> keeps track of what is happening in the cluster.
  - etcd --> hold aktuelle status of kubernetes cluster.
- 4 processes must run on master node:
  - API server (gateway): The API Server acts as the "gateway" or interface for all interactions with the Kubernetes cluster.
  - Scheduler: The Scheduler is responsible for placing or "scheduling" pods onto suitable nodes within the cluster.
  - Controller manager: Runs multiple controllers (e.g., Node Controller, Replication Controller, Endpoint Controller, and Service Account Controller) to ensure that the current cluster state matches the desired state.
  - etcd (cluster brain --> key value store, store the information of cluster)
- Worker nodes (Slave Node):
  each node contains multiple pods:
  - pod-1: backend app
  - pod-2: DB
- 3 processes must run on each worker Node:
  - container runtime: The container runtime is the underlying software that runs containers on the worker node. Including creating, starting, stopping, and deleting containers as requested by the Kubernetes control plane.
  - kubelet: kubelet is the main agent that runs on each worker node, interacting with the control plane and managing containers on that node.
  - kube proxy: kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each worker node, responsible for managing network connectivity and facilitating communication within the cluster.
- Virtual networks.
  enable to the communication between master and worker nodes.

## kubernetes configuration

- metadata
- spec
- status

## Helm

- Package manager for kubernetes.
- templating deployments for multiple similar micro-services with value.yaml
- release management

## Security

- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): to define roles and role bindings that grant specific permissions to a group of users.
- OIDC (OpenID Connect) is an authentication protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0. It enables applications to verify a user's identity based on the authentication performed by an external identity provider (IdP) and obtain basic profile information about the user. It is widely used for Single Sign-On (SSO) and federated identity scenarios.
- OAuth 2.0:
  - Client Credentials Flow: Server-to-Server
  - Authorization Code Flow: Client-to-Server
